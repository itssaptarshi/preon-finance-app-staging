```typescript
export interface PopulatableLiquity<R = unknown, S = unknown, P = unknown> extends _PopulatableFrom<SendableLiquity<R, S>, P> 
```
<b>Extends:</b> \_PopulatableFrom&lt;[SendableLiquity](./lib-base.sendableliquity.md)<!-- -->&lt;R, S&gt;, P&gt;

## Remarks

The functions return an object implementing [PopulatedLiquityTransaction](./lib-base.populatedliquitytransaction.md)<!-- -->, which can be used to send the transaction and get a [SentLiquityTransaction](./lib-base.sentliquitytransaction.md)<!-- -->.

Implemented by [PopulatableEthersLiquity](./lib-ethers.populatableethersliquity.md)<!-- -->.
